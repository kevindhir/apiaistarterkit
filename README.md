API.AI Starter Kit - An easy introduction to creating a sophisticated chat-bot with a Node.js powered backend.

Recognizing a lack of documentation and support for api.ai from Google's end due to the product being newly acquired, I decided I would create a tutorial based on my experience. The goal of this is to provide those who haven't used api.ai before a starting point to go forth and build their own innovative bots. I will be making a video to pair with this code, explain what it means, and walk through all the components. 

I've never created something like this before, so please bear with me!
